Create and submit 2 sound tracks (music or spoken word) and 2 sound effects (door slam, dog bark or whatever would fit with your project).

- These files must be your work, i.e. the sounds must be sounds that you recorded or ripped.

- The soundtracks may be music ripped using audacity, but they need to be your rips and not just stuff you downloaded online. I will look at technical details of these files to confirm this. 

- Use the metadata tag in Audacity to put your personal information in.

The files may be in .wav, .aac, .wma, .ogg or .mp3 format.They don't need to be any longer than about 15 seconds

The files may be compressed or zipped; since there are four files required and you can only submit one file for the assignment, this is actually pretty much required.
